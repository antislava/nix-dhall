  "body": "* Supports version 6.0.0 of the language standard\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v6.0.0\r\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Remove the `constructors` keyword\r\n    * ... as standardized in version 6.0.0 of the language standard\r\n    * The deprecation cycle is over, so the keyword is no longer supported\r\n    * For more details, see: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/wiki/Migration%3A-Deprecation-of-constructors-keyword\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/829\r\n* BREAKING CHANGE: CBOR-encode only special `Double`s as half-floats\r\n    * ... as standardized in version 6.0.0 of the language standard\r\n    * CBOR `Double`s except `Infinity`/`-Infinity`/`NaN`/`0.0` are now encoded in at\r\n      least 32 bits\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/822\r\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Sort record and union fields when CBOR-encoding\r\n    * Fields and alternatives are now sorted when serialized\r\n    * This does not affect semantic integrity checks, which already sorted these\r\n      fields/alternatives before hashing expressions\r\n    * This does affect the serialization of expressions that have not been\r\n      normalized (e.g. uninterpreted expressions transmitted over the wire)\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/835\r\n* BUG FIX: Fix non-exhaustive pattern match in `dhall lint`\r\n    * This fixes: `Irrefutable pattern failed for pattern Let (l' :| ls') d'`\r\n    * This bug would cause `dhall lint` to fail on some nested `let`/`in`\r\n      expressions\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/780\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/784\r\n* BUG FIX: Don't fail if `$HOME` environment variable is unset\r\n    * The interpreter was incorrectly throwing an exception if `HOME` was unset\r\n    * The standard requires that implementations should handle the `HOME`\r\n      environment variable being missing\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/789\r\n* Feature: Remove version tag from semantic integrity check\r\n    * ... as standardized in version 6.0.0 of the language standard\r\n    * This is not a breaking change because this change also includes\r\n      backwards-compatible support for semantic integrity checks produced by\r\n      older versions of the interpreter\r\n* Feature: Support Unicode path components\r\n    * ... as standardized in version 6.0.0 of the language standard\r\n    * You can now use Unicode in path components if they are quoted\r\n    * i.e. `./families/\"禺.dhall\"` is now legal\r\n* Feature: Add `Text/show` built-in\r\n    * ... as standardized in version 6.0.0 of the language standard\r\n    * You can now convert a `Text` literal to its equivalent Dhall source code\r\n      (which is itself a `Text` literal)\r\n    * This comes in handy when using Dhall code to generate JSON or Dhall code\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/811\r\n* Feature: Add `--immediate-dependencies`/`--transitive-dependencies` flags for\r\n  `dhall resolve`\r\n    * You can now retrieve all of your immediate or transitive dependencies as a\r\n      textual list\r\n    * This simplifies integration with other command-line tools (such as file\r\n      watchers)\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/795\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/803\r\n* Feature: `dhall freeze` now only freezes remote imports by default\r\n    * `dhall freeze` used to freeze all imports (including local imports and\r\n      environment variables)\r\n    * Now `dhall freeze` only freezes remote imports by default, which is what\r\n      most users want\r\n    * You can install freeze all imports using the `--all` flag\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/808\r\n* Feature: `:save` and `:load` REPL state\r\n    * `:save` with no arguments now saves the REPL state to a `.dhall-repl-N`\r\n       file\r\n    * The file format is a list of `dhall repl` commands\r\n    * You can use `:load` to load the saved state back into the REPL\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/807\r\n* Feature: Add `:hash` command to `dhall repl`\r\n    * This lets you conveniently hash expressions within the `dhall repl`\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/806\r\n* Feature: Add `--check` flag to `dhall format`\r\n    * Use this to check if the input is already formatted\r\n    * Useful for continuous integration when you want to ensure that all code\r\n      under version control remains formatted\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/810\r\n* Feature: Add  `UnionInputType` builder for `InputType`s\r\n    * This is the union analog of `RecordInputType`, letting you build a\r\n      record explicitly instead of deriving the instance using GHC generics\r\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/775\r\n* Feature: Add `:set`/`:unset` commands to `dhall repl`\r\n    * You can use these commands to set or unset command-line options\r\n    * Currently only setting/unsetting `--explain` is supported\r\n* Standards-compliance fixes:\r\n    * See:
